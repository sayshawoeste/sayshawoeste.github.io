<p> My name is Saysha Woeste, and I am a licensed and trained Dyslexia Specialist/Therapist (SLDS). I am passionate about helping children read with confidence and precision, no matter their reading difficulty.  </p>


<p> The best way to help a child who is experiencing any reading issue, which is a very common occurrence, is by having them do structured literacy therapy. When I am meeting with a parent and student, either online or in-person, they can expect professional interaction, intentional engagement, and purposeful activities and/or assignments. I begin with a an online literacy test to see where the child is at and then we move on from there, based on their level. </p>

<p> My goal is to work together with parents at building their child's literacy skills, so that they have the tools they need to become successful in whatever they desire to do. The program itself is online but includes interactive activities that keep students engaged, while also targeting areas that need worked on.  </p>

<p> Structured literacy therapy is the best way to treat any literacy challenge. The approach is based off Orton-Gillingham and has been proven, through much research and experience, to work incredibly for most every child.  </p>


<h2> I meet one on one with students, either via an online platform or in person, and guide them through a structured literacy program.  </h2>
